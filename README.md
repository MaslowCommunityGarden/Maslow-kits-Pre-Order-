### **Makerverse:**  

Makerverse is a GRBL CNC control application that has custom controls made specifically for the M2 and original Maslow. It can also connect to and control many other hobbyist CNC machines such as the X-carve and Shapeoko. The application is derived from the open source CNCjs project and will continue to receive new features and updates from the Maker Made team.
